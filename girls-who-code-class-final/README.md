# Toasty Visits Area 51
A python video game designed by eight 3rd-8th grade kids.

The project started January 2nd and three months laster, a group of awesome kids, with the help
of two mentors, programmed a video game start to finish.

They made everything! From the story, to the art, to the gameplay (Except the music), they 
all grouped together and made this happen.

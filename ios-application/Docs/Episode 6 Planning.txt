Flikitt Development Episode 6
------------------------

Add more functionality to Flikitt
	- Make toggling frame system (off and on)
	- Snapping a picture on a frame

Conditions: 
	- We don't want camera feed if there is already a picture in the frame.
	- We want a way to delete a picture on a frame (Turn camera UI into X)
	- We want camera feed in frames that have no capture (If and only if the camera is toggled)
	- Toggling system for camera, so that you can switch between frames that have
	pictures and frames that are just drawings?

Thinking of making Frames all have their own canvas?
If a frame has (hasPicture) true, then
	- Camera Feed is off.
	- The frame canvas will aquire a new Image with sprite of the picture just taken

Flikitt UI Design 4/8/2020

On the left hand side of the screen, there will be icons that represent subcatagories.
These subcatagroies can be clicked, and on the bottom of the screen, towards the left and right
buttons, there will be componets to be edited that pertain to the subcatagories.

On the right of the screen, the green "save" checkmark will remain
and the export button as well.

The bottom of the screen will have frame control, play and record sound

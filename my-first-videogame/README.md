## NOTE
This was my first programming endeavor, so I know the code is absolute spaghetti. This is more for me to laugh at.


This is <b>Dodge-A-Dot!</b> A video game I made to explore the pyxel engine for python.

<b>Goal: Avoid colliding with the white pixel enemies and reach the goal!</b>

            >>Attributes<<

<b>Lives:</b> Start the game with three lives. Die on zero lives, game is over.
 
<b>Money:</b> Get this by either colliding with coins or the goal. Use this in the shop to buy powerups.

<b>Score:</b> Granted by colliding with the goal, killing enemies with bombs, or collecting coins.

            >>Power-Ups<<

<b>Bombs:</b> Able to clear all enemies near you.

<b>Freeze:</b> Freeze enemies movement until you get to the goal

<b>Stored energy:</b> Use this to add an energy point back on to you current energy. Also, the more stored energy you have, the slower it will depleat when you move.

Please feel free to edit and append as you wish! I am trying to get better at python, so please be constructive and help me out!            
              
            >>Tip<<
<i>The game is simple in nature, but requires the use of power-ups in the later stages. Make sure you use the shop to your advantage! Don't let your money accumulate as it has no use for you when the game is over!</i>
